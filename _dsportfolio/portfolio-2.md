**Objective**

**This was a part of my personal project where I worked on Building A NLP Model to Classify the reviews from Amazon**

To classify reviews as positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2) based on the text/reviews provided by various users on Amazon using Machine Learning and Natual Language Processing Techniques

**Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)**

**How to determine if a review is positive or negative?**

We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be considered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
