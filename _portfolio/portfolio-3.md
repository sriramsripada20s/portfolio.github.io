**Abstract**

In this project we will have a look into various factors like life expectancy, GDP growth (%), Death Rates, Healthcare Expenditure (% of GDP), Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ index), Causes of Death for various diseases and many more variables which are affecting the global health and economies of countries and these variables are used to answer my research questions in this project


**Research Questions**

Below are my set of research questions based on three broad categories:

**Environmental Health Factors**

1. What is the average PM2.5 air pollution levels of various countries within a continent and what are healthy, unhealthy and very unhealthy countries within a continent based on PM2.5 Air pollution?

2. What is the variation in PM2.5 air pollution levels across different geographical locations (countries) and how does the variation in PM2.5 levels of countries between 2000 to 2019 correlate with average death rates per 1000 people?

3. Based on the above analysis, is it accurate to conclude that all healthy countries have lower death rates and that all very unhealthy countries have high death rates?

4. What is the average life expectancy and average PM 2.5(u mg) pollution levels of countries based on PM2.5 categorization of countries and do healthy countries have low life expectancy and unhealthy countries have high life expectancy?

5. Which regions have High Age-Standardized DALYs attributed to PM2.5 pollution per 100,000 population and what do you think might be the reason for it?

6. Based on the above analysis, do you think high population or population density is one of the reason for High DALY?

7. What is the Average Death Rate per 1000 people & Average DALY Attributable to PM2.5 (2019) of various countries within a region? Is there a consistent correlation between high Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and high death rates, and how does this relationship vary across different countries and regions?

**Healthcare Investment and Impact**
8. How have trends in healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP evolved over time among different countries?

9. What are the top N countries with the highest average healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP?

10. Does higher healthcare expenditure result in lower Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and reduced mortality rates?

11. What is the relationship between a country's health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the proportion of its population with access to safe drinking water facilities? Do you see any outliers?

12. How does average health expenditure as a percentage of GDP relate to the mortality rate per 100,000 people attributable to unsafe WASH services? What insights does this relationship offer regarding the effectiveness of healthcare investments in addressing sanitation-related health challenges?

13. What insights can be derived from the quadrant analysis between a country's median Health Access and Quality Index (HAQ) and its median GDP Growth Percentage? Are countries with High HAQ always performing well economically too?

14. What is the relationship between the Health Care Access Index (HAQ) and the number of doctors per 10,000 people in different countries or regions? Do countries with high number of doctors always have high HAQ Index?

15. How does the Human Development Index (HDI) of countries correlate with their Health Access and Quality (HAQ) index, and what insights does this relationship provide into healthcare accessibility of nations?

**Demographic and Disease-Specific Outcomes**

16. How do total mortality rates per 100,000 within distinct age group categories vary across countries from 2000 to 2019, and what insights can we draw from these variations in terms of healthcare needs and demographics?

17.How does the average Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) vary in different age groups in relation to the average number of deaths attributed to specific diseases, and what insights can this provide into the impact of these diseases on the overall health of various age cohorts?

Three dashboards have been created to answer my research questions. Dashboards are:

**1.Environmental Health Factors Dashboard** will help you explore the environmental effects of pollution, life expectancy, population density and average DALY rate in more detail across regions, countries and continents.

**2.Healthcare investment and Impact Dashboard** will help you explore average health expenditure as % of GDP, DALY rate, mortality rate due to unsafe wash surfaces, % of population having access to drinking water across various countries. Provides a view of the relationship between healthcare investment, health outcomes, and access to basic amenities

**3.Demographic and Disease Specific Outcomes Dashboard** will help you explore high deaths among different age groups and average number of years lost due to specific
