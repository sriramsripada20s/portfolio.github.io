## Flight Fare Prediction - a Classic Time Series Project
* Flight fare prediction is a classical problem of time series forecasting that finds trends in past observations to outline the future
* Many popular flight booking websites today, including Google Flights, showcase important insights on:
  * Current fair status: high, low or fair
  * Past fare trends, upcoming future trends and 
  * Helps decide the right time to book a flight ticket.


**Project Overview**

I built a Flight Fare Prediction App, that takes travel details as input, like: the departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, stoppages, airline carrier; to predict flight ticket price. With this understanding, users may have a better idea of what the cost would be on their upcoming travel

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh)

**The steps involved in my Project**

1. Data Ingestion using Python
   
3. Model Training using Random Forest Regressor
   
5. Model Deployment using Flask Web Application
   
7. Containerization using Docker.
   
9. Deploying Conatinersed model to Azure Cloud
