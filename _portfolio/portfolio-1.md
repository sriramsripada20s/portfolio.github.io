**Abstract**

Fault severity prediction is a crucial business statistic for telecom providers to create customer advocacy. In this [project](https://github.com/sriramsripada20s/Telstra_ML_endtoend_Project), we use data mining techniques to predict fault severity at a location. We evaluate various machine learning models based on classification metrics.

**Objective**

To predict Fault Severity at particular time and location based on log data available Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many)

**Deployed Streamlit web app on Heroku Cloud created so that users could explore my LGBM Classification model predicting the Telstra network's Fault Severity at a time at a particular location based on the log data available.**
