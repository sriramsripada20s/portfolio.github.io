**Project Details**
1. Built an end to end data science pipeline to handle various stages of data science project. Right from Data Ingestion to Model Deployment.
2. Built Machine learning model and streamlit web web application for Customer Credit churn predictions.
3. Used MLFLOW for machine learning model tracking and logging.
4. Deployed my web app on Amazon EC2 infrastructure.
