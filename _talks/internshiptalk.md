**Presented my Data Science Summer Internship findings at Data Science for Social Good Conference**

The [Florida Data Science for Social Good (FL-DSSG) program](https://dssg.unf.edu/2023program.html) is a 12-week internship that invites students to tackle data-rich projects with the potential for substantial social impact. The 2023 FL-DSSG program supported seven interns from various disciplines( I am one among the seven interns) and three nonprofit organizations in Florida.

**This is me explaining about Topic Modeling and Text Mining**
